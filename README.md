# neural-networks
machine learning to predict which sex by weight.


Introduced neurons, the building blocks of neural networks.
Used the sigmoid activation function in our neurons.
Saw that neural networks are just neurons connected together.
Created a dataset with Weight and Height as inputs (or features) and Gender as the output (or label).
Learned about loss functions and the mean squared error (MSE) loss.
Realized that training a network is just minimizing its loss.
Used backpropagation to calculate partial derivatives.
Used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to train our network.
